# Title

## Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

For our project we decided to make use of both UCDP (complemented with GDELT) and Twitter datasets. From these, we would like to figure out any existing biases in the information proliferation around the globe, regarding the conflicts' locations.

As for our story, we thought it would be interesting to shed some light on world-wide situations to which the general public might be oblivious to. Bear in mind, our purpose is not to figure out *why* these biases may exist (e.g. political or media influences) but *where* they exist.
