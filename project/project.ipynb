Although this library's reliability increases with the text's length - and hence a bit limited for Tweets - it tends to give more *false negatives* than *false positives*. This is not a problem since we have a large amount of data and we would rather discard some English Tweets than keeping others in foreign languages."

    "## Named Entity Recognition (NER)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the trickiest part of the project. The main goal is to find whether or not a Tweet is talking about a country. For this part, we opted to use a natural language processing library called [Spacy](https://spacy.io/), for a couple of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simple text comparison tends to over-identify entities in a text (loose words might match but, contextually, they might not be referring to a place)\n",
    "2. Other alternatives, like [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) tended to be slower\n",
    "3. Spacy comes with built-in models trained with [OntoNotes 5](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc2013t19), giving us a wide range of entity labels to work with\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it seems to work quite well, we noticed many cases where it may (or not) consider certain entities based on their capitalization alone. To minimize these errors, we created a [Tweet Generator](https://github.com/nunomota/ada2017-hw/blob/master/project/analyzers/Auxiliary/tweets_generator.ipynb). This notebook creates Markov Chains models by analysing several corpus we provide (stories, geo-political or religious texts, news, etc...) and, through the [markovify library](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify), it generates several texts with specified length (in this case 140, which is a Tweet's max length). The aim is to, as a next step, go through its interactive generator and manually specify what we find in the generated text. From the overall output of that process we expect to find which text-formatting techniques provide a higher accuracy for our NER model (e.g. lower-case text for cities, upper-case for countries or title-case for religions).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also enriched our data with many other datasets (also specified in the [project's root README](https://github.com/nunomota/ada2017-hw/blob/master/project/README.md)), creating bi-lateral associations between:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Countries\n",
    "* Cities\n",
    "* Nationalities\n",
    "* Religions\n",
    "* Religious affiliations\n",
    "* Currencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we don't just keep Tweets that directly refer to a country. In the context of *religions*, *cities* and *currencies* there are a lot of possible countries related to a single word (e.g. several countries might have a city with the same name). In these cases, we take into account the probability each entity is referring to each country. We then take all of the entities, analyze the probabilities and find which are the *most likely* countries. If a country is within that set of values and its probability is above a certain threshold, we assume the Tweet is referring to it."
