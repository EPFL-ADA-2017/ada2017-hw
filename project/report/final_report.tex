\begin{abstract}
In this project we focus on certain conflicts that would be expected to arise public concern and obtain a numerical approximation of the sentimental impact that said conflicts have on Twitter. We then use the estimated impact for conflicts in several countries to try and find if the impact depends on the country of the conflict. We used the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) dataset to identify comparable conflicts in different countries and continents. The main purpose of this project is to shed some light on world-wide situations to which the general public might be oblivious to.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

For our project we decided to make use of both UCDP and Twitter datasets. From these, we would like to figure out any existing gaps in the information proliferation around the globe, regarding the conflicts' locations.

As to how we will make that information clear, we decided to create a predictive model. This model takes a conflicts' category and country as features and tries to predict the sentimental impact on Twitter. To do this, we will use techniques like Named Entity Recognition and Sentiment Analysis to find out which Tweets are worth considering, for a given conflict, and their sentiment strength (not if they are positive, negative or neutral but their strength from 0.0 to 1.0). Analysing the sentiment strength before and after a conflict's start date, we would then define sentimental impact in the same range of values (from 0.0 to 1.0). Applying a threshold to the results would give us either impactful or not impactful - which is what our model will try to predict. Would people show stronger emotions towards a country where a conflict arose? Or would they seem to ignore this fact and maintain their normal behavior?

Note: Remove stuff from here and instead introduce a bit of the methodology, i.e.  first select tweets around a conflict's date, then identify the tweets that refer to a certain country, then get their sentiment analysis, then measure the general sentiment analysis for tweets about that country on that date, then compare for dates before and after the conflict to measure the sentimental impact.


\section{Related Work}
Don't know what goes here. Maybe remove this section? I also tried to find articles on this but I could not find any.


\section{Data Collection}
(they say it should be brief) I'm not sure about this one, since I don't know if we should skip this section or maybe here we should explain other datasets that we use. Maybe we can change the name of this section and move it 1 or 2 sections below?


\section{Dataset Description}
  \subsection{UCDP Dataset}
  \label{sub:ucdp_dataset}
  The UCDP dataset contains data for $133 012$ worldwide conflicts from 1989 until 2016. Other information available for  conflicts relevant for our analysis is:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Type of violence - Categorical variable that classifies conflicts into \emph{State-Based},  \emph{Non-State} and \emph{One-Sided} violence.
    \item Location - Coordinates, region and country are available. We are only interested in the country.
    \item Start and end dates - They can be used to calculate the duration of the conflict.
    \item Number of casualties - Both the total number and the casualties on each side involved are available. We consider only the total number.
  \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection*{UCDP Dataset Filtering}
    \label{ssub:dataset_filtering}
    Since the number of worldwide active users on Twitter has increased throughout the years ~\cite{arrojo2015social} and we are assuming that the topics covered in the tweets changed as well, we focus on conflicts that took place during 2016 - the most recent year. It is also more likely that the public reacts to certain types of violence over others, and therefore for our analysis we only consider the one-sided violence events. This type of violence represents 13.7\% of the conflicts in 2016, as well as 10.7\% of casualties in that year. Table \ref{tab:ucdp16stats} contains the statistics of these conflicts.

    \begin{table}[h]
      \begin{center}
      \begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|}
      \hline
      & \bf Casualties & \bf Duration &
      \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}\bf N. per\\\bf country\end{tabular} \\
      \hline
      mean & 6.5 & 3 days & 22.9\\
      std & 19.9 & 21 days & 33.8\\
      min & 0 & 0 days & 1\\
      25\% & 1 & 0 days & 2\\
      50\% & 2 & 0 days & 6\\
      75\% & 5 & 0 days & 25.5\\
      max & 324 & 334 days & 106\\
      \hline
      count & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{893}\\
      \hline
      \end{tabular}
      \end{center}
      \caption{\label{tab:ucdp16stats} Statistics for one-sided conflicts in 2016}
    \end{table}

    As shown in the table, the number of casualties per conflict varies from 0 to 324. We assume that the public reaction will be higher for conflicts with casualties and as a result only conflicts with casualties are considered.

    Table \ref{tab:ucdp16stats} also includes the number of conflicts per each country, since we are assuming that the general public is likely to lose interest on the violent events that take place in a country where conflicts are very frequent. Therefore for this analysis we consider only the countries where there were at most three one-sided violent conflicts with casualties during 2016.

    The statistics for the final filtered conflicts are shown in Table \ref{tab:ucdp16fstats}. The result is 30 conflicts from 18 different countries.

    \begin{table}[h]
      \begin{center}
      \begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|}
      \hline
      & \bf Casualties & \bf Duration &
      \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}\bf N. per\\\bf country\end{tabular} \\
      \hline
      mean & 8 & 0 days & 1.67 \\
      std & 16.9 & 1 days & 0.69 \\
      min & 1 & 0 days & 1 \\
      25\% & 1 & 0 days & 1 \\
      50\% & 2 & 0 days & 2 \\
      75\% & 5 & 0 days & 2 \\
      max & 86 & 5 days & 3 \\
      \hline
      count & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{30}\\
      \hline
      \end{tabular}
      \end{center}
      \caption{\label{tab:ucdp16fstats} Statistics for filtered conflicts}
    \end{table}

  \subsection{Other Datasets}
  \label{sub:other_datasets}
    Explain here the datasets used for NER, etc (?)
\section{Methods}
(With math and description of main algorithms)
I have to explain how and why I measure sentiment average and sentimental impact in those ways., for the first one I can reference a book.
(Next TODO)
  \subsection{Language Recognition}
  \label{sub:language_recognition}
    I'm not sure about including this one!

  \subsection{Named Entity Recognition}
  \label{sub:named_entity_recognition}
    For each time-frame, we do Named Entity Recognition (NER) to figure out the country it is talking about - discard all that don't mention countries of conflict.

  \subsection{Sentiment Analysis}
  \label{sub:sentiment_analysis}
    For the remaining Tweets, we apply Sentiment Analysis on the text and store that information alongside the Tweets.

  \subsection{Sentimental Impact Measurement}
  \label{sub:sentimental_impact_measurement}
    We then define the Sentimental Impact as a measure that reflects the contrast between the average daily sentiment strength before and after the conflict.

\section{Results and Findings}
With the current schema of the report (based on the README for milestone 2) I think we would not have anything to write here.

\section{Conclusions}
I don't know about this and the previous section yet.
The next page contains some \emph{sample} things that I kept for reference.

\end{table}

\subsection{The First Page}
\label{ssec:first}
Long titles should be typed on two lines
without a blank line intervening. Approximately, put the title at 2.5
cm from the top of the page, followed by a blank line, then the
author's names(s).

\subsection{Sections}

{\bf Headings}: Do not number subsubsections.

{\bf Citations}: Citations within the text appear in parentheses
as~\cite{Gusfield:97} or, if the author's name appears in the text
itself, as Gusfield~\shortcite{Gusfield:97}.  Append lowercase letters
to the year in cases of ambiguity.  Treat double authors as
in~\cite{Aho:72}, but write as in~\cite{Chandra:81} when more than two
authors are involved. Collapse multiple citations as
in~\cite{Gusfield:97,Aho:72}. Also refrain from using full citations
as sentence constituents. We suggest that instead of
\begin{quote}
  ``\cite{Gusfield:97} showed that ...''
\end{quote}
you use
\begin{quote}
``Gusfield \shortcite{Gusfield:97}   showed that ...''
\end{quote}

\textbf{Please do not use anonymous citations}

\textbf{References}: Gather the full set of references together under
the heading {\bf References}. Arrange the references alphabetically
by first author, rather than by order of occurrence in the text.
Provide as complete a citation as possible, using a consistent format,
such as the one for {\em Computational Linguistics\/} or the one in the
{\em Publication Manual of the American
Psychological Association\/}~\cite{APA:83}. Use of full names for
authors rather than initials is preferred.  A list of abbreviations
for common computer science journals can be found in the ACM
{\em Computing Reviews\/}~\cite{ACM:83}.

\subsection{Footnotes}

{\bf Footnotes}: \footnote{This is how a footnote should appear.}

\subsection{Graphics}

{\bf Illustrations}: Place figures, tables, and photographs in the
report near where they are first discussed, rather than at the end, if
possible.  Wide illustrations may run across both columns.

{\bf Captions}: Provide a caption for every illustration; number each one
sequentially in the form:  ``Figure 1. Caption of the Figure.'' ``Table 1.
Caption of the Table.''  captions of the figures and
tables below the body.
