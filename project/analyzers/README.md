# Analyzers directory

This directory contains all the notebooks used to evaluate, plot and/or study the performance or behaviour of certain models we use. It can also be used to more fine-grain analyze some datasets and figure out which information might prove more useful for us.

This directory represents the 2nd step in the data pipeline: 
1. [parsers](https://github.com/nunomota/ada2017-hw/tree/master/project/parsers)
2. [**analyzers**](https://github.com/nunomota/ada2017-hw/tree/master/project/analyzers)
3. [filters](https://github.com/nunomota/ada2017-hw/tree/master/project/filters)
