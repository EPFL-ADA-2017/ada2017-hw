# Data directory

This directory contains all the datasets used throughout the project. It is sub-divided into two directories (*raw* and *parsed*) that have the same inner structure - for clarity reasons.

## Raw datasets

The *raw* directory contains all the 'raw' information as obtained by us directly from a source.

## Parsed datasets

The *parsed* directory contains all the 'parsed' information, trated and filtered to satisfy ou project's needs.
